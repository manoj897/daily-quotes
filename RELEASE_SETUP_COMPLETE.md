## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Create Google Play Developer Account
1. Go to https://play.google.com/console/signup
2. Pay $25 one-time fee
3. Wait for account verification (1-2 days)
4. Create new app listing for "Daily Quotes"

### Step 2: Set Up API Access
1. In Play Console → Settings → API access
2. Create new service account
3. Download JSON credentials
4. Save as `play-store-credentials.json` in project root
5. Grant "Release Manager" role to the service account

### Step 3: Prepare Store Assets
You'll need to create these assets manually:

**Required Graphics:**
- App Icon: 512x512 PNG
  - Save to: `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png`

- Feature Graphic: 1024x500 PNG
  - Save to: `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/featureGraphic.png`

- Phone Screenshots: At least 2, max 8 (1080x1920 recommended)
  - Save to: `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/1.png`, `2.png`, etc.

**How to take screenshots:**
```bash
# Run the app
./build_android.sh

# Take screenshots using Android Studio or:
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot.png
adb pull /sdcard/screenshot.png
```

### Step 4: Privacy Policy
Create a privacy policy (required by Google Play):
- Use https://privacypolicygenerator.info/
- Host it on a website (GitHub Pages, your website, etc.)
- You'll add the URL in Play Console

### Step 5: Complete Play Console Listing
Fill out these required sections:
- Store listing (auto-filled from Fastlane metadata)
- App content (privacy policy, ads declaration, target audience)
- Content rating (complete questionnaire)
- Pricing & distribution (select countries)

## 🚀 Release Commands

### Build Release AAB Locally
```bash
fastlane android build_release
```

Output: `composeApp/build/outputs/bundle/release/composeApp-release.aab`

### First Release (Manual Upload - Recommended)
For your very first release, manually upload to Play Console:

1. Build the AAB:
   ```bash
   fastlane android build_release
   ```

2. Go to Play Console → Daily Quotes → Production
3. Click "Create new release"
4. Upload the AAB file
5. Complete all required sections
6. Submit for review

### Subsequent Releases (Automated with Fastlane)
After your first release is approved:

```bash
# Deploy to production
fastlane android deploy_production

# Or deploy to internal testing first
fastlane android deploy_internal
```

---

## 📦 Version Updates

For each new release:

1. **Update version in `gradle.properties`:**
   ```properties
   # Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
   VERSION_NAME=1.0.1
   VERSION_CODE=2
   ```

2. **Create changelog:**
   ```bash
   # Create file: fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/2.txt
   echo "Bug fixes and improvements" > fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/2.txt
   ```

3. **Build and deploy:**
   ```bash
   fastlane android deploy_production
   ```

**Version Code Rules:**
- Must always increment (never reuse)
- Must be an integer
- Play Store uses this to determine update order

## 🔐 Security Checklist

**NEVER commit these files to git:**
- ✅ `*.keystore` - Excluded in .gitignore
- ✅ `keystore.properties` - Excluded in .gitignore
- ✅ `play-store-credentials.json` - Excluded in .gitignore

**Backup securely:**
- ✅ Copy `~/daily-quotes-release.keystore` to secure cloud storage
- ✅ Save passwords in password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)

**Before every commit:**
```bash
git status
# Verify no sensitive files are staged
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean
fastlane android build_release
```

### Keystore Not Found
Check that `keystore.properties` has correct path:
```properties
storeFile=/Users/manoj.krishnan/daily-quotes-release.keystore
```

### Play Store Upload Fails
Verify:
1. `play-store-credentials.json` exists in project root
2. Service account has "Release Manager" role in Play Console
3. App has been created in Play Console

### ProGuard Errors
If you add new dependencies, you may need to add keep rules to:
`composeApp/proguard-rules.pro`
